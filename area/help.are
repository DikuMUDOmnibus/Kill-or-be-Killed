said to be true hunters, free of vices and masturbatory virtues, namless in
their hunt and identity.
 
It is also said that the caves of Ancient have drawn on powers from the Abyssal
Planes to call upon in their hunt.
~

0 'UTEROI'~
The manuscript of the Uteroi is rumored to be found underground within the lair 
of the onyx dracolich.  Nothing more has ever been recorded of this 
religion, nor would anyone be so foolish as to attempt doing so. The manuscript
exists because its very creation was by the blood and power that is the
unholy dracolich.

-1 DIKU~
.                    Original game idea, concept, and design:

~

-1 GOLD SILVER MONEY~
Midgaard's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the lowly copper,
which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).  Gold coins are worth
100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the pound, as 
opposed to 100 to the pound for silver). Gems can be bought to alleviate weight problems
from the Midgaard jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more than they are worth.
10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth more than 100 gold pieces for
the highest quality stones.
~

0 BRIEF COMPACT~
Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact 
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~

-1 DEAF~
The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly 
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~

-1 AFK~
Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
recall.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).
~

-1 PROMPT~
Syntax: prompt
Syntax: prompt all
Syntax: prompt <%*>
 
PROMPT with out an argument will turn your prompt on or off.
 
PROMPT ALL will give you the standard "<hits mana moves>" prompt.
 
PROMPT <%*> where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself.
 
        %h :  Display your current hits
        %H :  Display your maximum hits
        %m :  Display your current mana
        %M :  Display your maximum mana
        %v :  Display your current moves
        %V :  Display your maximum moves
        %x :  Display your current experience
	%X :  Display experience to level
        %g :  Display your gold held
	%s :  Display silver carried
        %a :  Display your alignment
        %r :  Display the room name you are in
	%e :  Display the exits from the room in NESWDU style
	%c :  Display a carriage return (useful for multi-line prompts)
        %R :  Display the vnum you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)
        %z :  Display the area name you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)
 
Example:  PROMPT <%hhp %mm %vmv>
        Will set your prompt to "<10hp 100m 100mv>"

~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of your
chosen hometown. Your corpse is left behind in the room you were killed
in, together with all of you equipment.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount will vary depending on
your current experience and the maximum experience you may have gained
previously prior to other deaths.

Corpses decay after time, and if they do any items inside them will be
returned to the pit of the hometown you recall to. Player corpses last
*roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Be warned: Anyone may loot anyone else's corpse.

If you die 4 times you will lose 1 point of constitution. Should you be
reduced to less than 3 constitution you will collapse and expire
premenantly...have that final goodbye note ready:).

See also: 'help age'
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after 
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.

New pets are planned for a shop in New Thalos.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>
 
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
~

-1 NOTE NOTES CHANGES NEWS PENALTY IDEA UNREAD~
The notes on ROM replace the bulletin boards and mail systems found on many
other mud.  The following options are usable:

reading notes:
note list	: show all notes (unread notes are marked with an N)
note read	: either by number, or read next to read unread notes
note remove	: removes a note that you wrote or are the target of
note catchup	: markes all notes as read

writing new notes:
note to		: sets the to line (playername, clanname, immortal, or all)
note subject	: sets the subject for a new note
note +		: adds a line to a new note (i.e. note + hi guys!)
note -		: remove a line from a note in progress
note clear	: erase a note in progress
note show	: shows the note you are working on
note post	: posts a new note. This MUST be done to post a note.

When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type
note read to scroll through them one at a time.

Four other note directories exist, these are ideas, news, changes, and 
penalties (gods only).  They are used the exact same way, for example
idea read 5 will read idea #5.  Posting to the news and changes boards is
restricted. The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread notes on
all the note spools.
~

0 GOSSIP CGOSSIP . SHOUT YELL~
Syntax: gossip  <message>
Syntax: cgossip <message>
Syntax: shout   <message>
Syntax: yell    <message>

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

GOSSIP and CGOSSIP are variants of SHOUT (without the delay).  '.' is a 
synonym for GOSSIP.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

Type a channel name by itself to turn it off.
~

0 EMOTE PMOTE POSE SOCIAL~
Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK
(type socials or help socials for a listing).

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Alander will be read as bonks you by Alander, and
as bonks Alander by everyone else).

POSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.
~

52 SMOTE~
Syntax: smote <action>

Smote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in
the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.

See also: help 'dual wield', help 'trinal wield'
~

0 BUG TYPO~
Syntax: bug <message>
Syntax: idea <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

Syntax: areas
Syntax: commands
Syntax: report
Syntax: score
Syntax: time
Syntax: weather

AREAS shows you a list of areas in the game.

COMMANDS shows you all the commands in the game.

REPORT shows your current statistics to you and also announces them to other
players in the room.  SCORE shows much more detailed statistics to you only.
Your ability scores are shown as true value(current value), so for example
Str: 15(23) means you have a 15 strength from training, but a 23 strength
from other factors (spells or items).

TIME shows the game time, as well as the time the mud was last started,
and the current local time for the host computer.

WEATHER shows the current game weather.
~

-1 WHO~
Syntax: who
Syntax: who <level-range>
Syntax: who <class or race>
Syntax: who <clan name>

who elf cleric  lists all elven clerics
who demise e m  lists all elven mages in Demise (hi Alander!)

Classes and races may be abbreviated.
~

Syntax: whois <name>
The whois command identifies any user who matches the name given. For
example, 'whois a' shows all characters whose name begins with A.
~

0 WHERE~
Syntax: where
Syntax: where <character>

WHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the same
area as you are.

WHERE with an argument tells you the location of one character with that name
within your area, including monsters.
~

0 HELP~
Syntax: help
Syntax: help <keyword>

HELP without any arguments shows a one-page command summary.

HELP <keyword> shows a page of help on that keyword.  The keywords include
all the commands, spells, and skills listed in the game.
~

0 DESCRIPTION DESC~
Syntax: description <string>
Syntax: description + <string>
Syntax: description - 

Sets your long description to the given string.  If the description string
starts with a '+', the part after the '+' is appended to your current
description, so that you can make multi-line descriptions. You can delete
lines by uses description -.
~

0 PASSWORD~

The game supplies a title when your character is created and when you
advance a level.  You can use TITLE to set your title to something else.
~

0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy.
~

0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK~
Syntax: open   <object|direction>
Syntax: close  <object|direction>
Syntax: lock   <object|direction>
Syntax: unlock <object|direction>

you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 DRINK EAT FILL POUR~
Syntax: drink <object>
Syntax: eat   <object>
Syntax: fill  <object>
Syntax: pour  <object> out
Syntax: pour  <object> <object>
Syntax: pour  <object> <character>

When you are thirsty, DRINK something.

When you are hungry, EAT something.

FILL fills a drink container with water.

POUR transfers a liquid to a container, or empties one.
You can also pour from an object into something a character is holding.

If you go without food for too long you will begin to starve. If you
continue to neglect your stomach's needs you'll find yourself slowly
taking damage and dying.
Likewise if you do not drink for a long period of time you will start to
dehydrate, and when this becomes critical (you'll know from the messages
you'll be getting) you'll start taking small amounts of damage. This
damage will slowly increase as you dehydrate further.

Moral: Eat, drink and be merry.

~

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.
~

0 SACRIFICE~
Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to Mota, who may reward you.
The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.
~

0 SCROLL~
Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number>

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the 
default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.
~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.
~

0 VISIBLE~
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to Mota for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not 
insure success.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.
~

-1 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).
Examples:
split 30 	--> split 30 silver
split 20 50	--> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10	--> split 10 gold
~

0 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.

There are penalties for using STEAL on other players.

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.
~

60 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

60 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

58 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
	ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
	ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~

59 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.
~

56 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROM. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 51), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~

59 DENY~
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.
~

57 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~

57 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~

53 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 57 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. 

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

56 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~

56 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~

58 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)
~

55 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~

55 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noemote   <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~

57 PARDON~
Syntax: pardon <character> killer
	pardon <character> thief

Pardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you
are sure they deserve it.  Being killed by Hassan acts as an automatic
pardon.
~

56 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~

56 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~

57 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~

55 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~

54 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~

54 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.
~

52 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.
~

52 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 60 characters are totally 
invisible.
~

52 INCOGNITO~
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes
a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see
you regarless of location.
~

52 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~

56 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~

53 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~

53 MWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
~

55 PEACE~
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~

52 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: pooffout <message>

'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~

59 PROTECT~
Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing 
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.
~

55 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~

54 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
	return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.
~

51 IMMTALK :~
Syntax: immtalk <message>

turns it back on).
~

52 WIZNET~
Syntax: wiznet 
	wiznet show
	wiznet status
	wiznet <field>

Wiznet is sort of an immortal news service, to show important events to
the wiznetted immoral.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off, 
wiznet show lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here), 
wiznet status shows your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles
a field on and off.  The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not,
fiddle with them a while.  More events are available at higher levels.

0 'DISPEL MAGIC' CANCELLATION~
Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character>
        cast 'cancellation' <characte>
 
Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target.  Dispel magic
has a reduced chance of working, and is considering an attack spell.
Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.
 
The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may
be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.
~

weapon grows more and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or
destroyed by the magic.  Also, every successful enchant increases the level
of the weapon by one...and there is no turning back.
~

-1 'ENCHANT ARMOR'~
The enchant armor spell imbues armor with powerful protective magics. It is
not nearly as reliable as enchant weapon, being far more prone to destructive

This spell saps the experience points, mana, and movement points of its
target.

a weapon in a fashion similar to envenom ('help envenom'), but with 
drastically reduced effectiveness.

your message.

	that you should use one of the following letters,
		{r{{r     red     {c{{c     cyan
		{g{{g     green   {y{{y     yellow
		{b{{b     blue    {w{{w     white
		{m{{m     magenta {x{{x     clear(reset colour)
		{{{{      {{ char {{*       beep
		{{/       newline
	when using color, it looks better if you finish the line
	with whatever color it would normally be in, such as a
	gossip, the color is magenta, so:
		{mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world{m'{x
	looks better than:
		{mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world'{x

-1 TARTARUS~
Tartarus code was started in late 1996 and completed around mid 1997. It
was developed at darkmists.mudservices.com for use on the mud Dark Mists
and used Rom2.4b3 code. The original coder on the mud was Thrym who
began the mud with Styx, who contributed ideas and help. Ceran joined
the team and contributed most of the core code, including all the class
and clan skills/spells as well as the majority of fully new code, before
leaving in 1997 because of conflicts with the other immortals.

This code release is named Tartarus and contains Ceran's original coding
plus rewritten code. This code is for use on Rom2.4b muds, although it can
be easily hacked for parts to use on other code bases. It is provided
solely for the MUDing community as a way of giving back to it what has
been freely given many times before.
The following people contributed to the Tartarus release:

Code --
	Thrym who installed the MOBProgs patch into the base ROM code.

Areas --
	-Lilith (Arkham) (Unable to contact this person. See 
         README.tararus file which comes with this derivative code)
	-Kay, who wrote a lot of Nightfall and Thorbardin.
	-Zenan, who did Rakshasa Domain when I got bogged down with code
         and other areas.

52 COMMANDMENTS 'GOD RULES' GODS~
.

		=== Commandments of Thera ===
		
These rules also apply to all Immortals.

1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
    Any immortal found killing a mortal will be deleted.

2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own.
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,
    and softening up or altering mobs, handing out equipment.
    
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly

4)  DO NOT use reboot unless you have a very good reason.

5)  Do not induct anyone into a clan just because they ask. Clans grant 
    special abilities and are a reward for good playing.

6)  Do NOT create and keep objects which are limited. If you choose to
    keep limited equipment then you should stay mortal instead. Limited
    equipment is for mortals to fight over and earn, not for Immortals
    whom mortal players can never kill.

7)  If you are running a quest make sure you balance the prize(s). Do not 
    hand out anything that will upset the balance of the MUD.

8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
    
9)  Do not try to overrule each other.

10) Do not ban a site without posting a note about why it was banned.
    Likewise do not unban a site without consulting other Immortals first.

REMEMBER : 
As an Immortal you have chosen to build and work on the mud. If you simply
want to play then stay mortal and enjoy the fun, but as an Immortal you
are expected to do certain duties and a minimum of building (you are also
supposed to have fun, but if that's all you want to do - sit and talk,
play around etc - then you should choose to be mortal and allow others to
immort and build).

These are the rules for Immortals to follow.

-1 PK PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER
STEALING'~
Player Killing (PK) Rules:

Player killing and player stealing are allowed for anyone over level 10.
You will see a (PK) flag next to anyone you can attack -- you yourself
will always be in your own PK range. If you kill in town you may become a
criminal if an Enforcer flags you wanted. In this case cityguards and
Enforcer guards may all attack you, even guards who's masters are out of
PK range.

Charmies of masters who are not in your PK will not be attackable, nor
will they be able to normally harm you. If you find that people are
somehow able to use pets/charmies to kill out of PK then note to immortal
about it and we will look into the problem.

You must be level 10 or over to PK, and anyone below level 10 is immune to
PKers.
~

-1 RULES~
Rules on KBK:
----------------------------

- Do not spam, this lags the MUD for you and everyone else. This includes
spamming yells, tells, say, prays, emotes, etc.

- Player Killing (PK), is encouraged on KBK. You may PK
and be PK'd by anyone in your range once your "newbie" status wears off.

- Roleplaying is not enforced but encouraged. Don't hope for anything but
the norm without a bit of roleplaying. This includes things like cabals,
tattoes, quest skills, titles, etc.

- Descriptions are not mandatory but we judge your character by the effort
put into it, this strongly helps the outcome of your character.

- Your being here is a privilege, and a privilege we reserve the right to
take away at any time. If you are caught cheating or helping someone else
cheat, expect to be denied and/or banned. If you feel you've been pushished
wrongly please send a note to "immortal" or bring it up on the Forum.

- Multi-Charring is {RNOT{x allowed here. This includes logging on two chars
at the same time, passing equipment between chars, using out of character
information to obtain special things, and killing a character and looting him
with another character of your own. This will result in your being denied,
if the problem continues you will be banned for a long period of time.

- Do not try to copy equipment, at all. If you are caught doing this you will
be banned from the MUD and most likely not let back for a long, long time.

- The word of an immortal is final, if an immortal tells you to do something,
do it. If you feel an immortal is telling you to do something wrong, leave a
note to "immortal" about it.

- Hoarding limited items is grounds for first, it being taken from you, and
second your being slain. Do not hold over a half screen or so of limited eq
for long. It keeps the good stuff away from others. Just sac it or give it
to cabal mates. *Giving it to your other chars or OOC Friends will get you
denied without a single word in.

- An immortal may find other smaller things that are cheating but not posted
here offensive. If you are caught for something an Immortal tells you is wrong,
it is (at least until an implementor or another implementor decides otherwise).

-- These rules apply to mortals and Immortals alike. If you are caught breaking
any of the rules above, you will be punished. You have been warned!

~

0 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~
The most populous species in the world, Humans are found in every walk 
of life and come in just about every shape, size, and coloring. They 
average 6' in height. Magical devices tend to benefit them greatly. 
They may follow any path (good/neutral/evil).
~

0 ELF ELVES~
Slightly taller but lighter in build than Humans, Elves lack the 
strength of other races, but are more agile, both mentally and 
physically. Averaging 6'5" in height, Elves are fair skinned and have 
golden blonde to reddish to brown hair, and their eyes are usually 
green or blue (although there are some grey-eyed Elves). 
Elves are magical in nature, and it is rare to find an Elf who has 
forsworn magic. They are somewhat resistant to charm spells and 
other magic, but a strong spell can penetrate that resistance. Elves 
are difficult to locate and often walk unnoticed. Infravision allows 
them to see in the dark. Elves must stay good in order to keep their 
magical abilities. Elves who have turned to evil (even to neutrality) 
are frowned upon.

Syntax: snare

Using materials from the wilderness, a ranger is able to put together a
cunningly-hidden snare in which they can capture unsuspecting foes.

0 DARK-ELF DARKELF DARKELVES DARK~
Averaging 5'6", with ebony skin and stark white or silver hair, and eyes
that spark red with infravision (although there are a few who have 
lavender eyes), Dark-Elves are a species of renegade Elf who have turned
their energy toward evil. They are highly intelligent but not as studious
as Elves, and their nimbleness has been honed nearly to perfection through
generations of thievery and trouble-making. Like Elves, they can walk
unnoticed and are not easily locatable, and they are magical and resistant
to charm spells. Dark-Elves must remain evil to keep their magical
abilities. Dark-Elves who have turned to good (or neutrality) are frowned
upon.
~

0 GREY-ELF GREYELF GREYELVES GREY~
In physical appearance much like Elves, you really cannot tell them 
apart just by looking at them. Grey Elves came into being as the 
offspring of Elves and Dark-Elves, neither inherently good nor 
inherently evil. Such breeding was common practice during surface 
raids, a torture set upon female Elves by male Dark-Elves, and in 
some cases as a part of the torture of male Elves by female 
Dark-Elves (who after the breeding made a bloody sacrifice of the 
male Elves). Grey Elves average about 5'10" in height. It is as a 
result of their mixed heritage that Grey Elves have chosen not to 
follow the Light, nor to walk entirely in Shadow, but to move between 
the paths, seeking balance (although not always finding it). Grey 
Elves may be neutral only or risk losing their ability to cast magic. 
Grey Elves are highly intelligent and very wise, although not as
nimble as Dark-Elves, and are, for the most part, very likeable.
~

0 CENTAUR CENTAURS~
An offbreed species between 5'8" and 6'3" in height. They are half
man and half beast. Brute strength and raw power are their thing. 
They make good warriors (if you get past their infighting and 
other untrustworthy attributes). Centaurs are resistant to most
diseases and poisons. They excel in enhanced damage and bashing. 
All centaurs are good.
~

0 GIANT GIANTS STORM CLOUD FIRE~
These mighty people once lived in the mountains north of Thalos.
They lived by themselves in colonies and villages.  This was their way of
life until people started exploring and expanding into their lands.  The
ginats immediately took up arms against these people and tried to defend
the invasion.  The giants soon found themselves outnumbered by the humans
and other races invading their lands.  They gave up and accepted this new
way of life. Eventually groups of giants dispersed throughout Thera, and
they became just as "normal" as any other race.
         Giants are the largest sentient species in the land. They average 
around 12-13' in height, although some have been sighted who are 27'  
tall. Due to their size, they tend to resist blows well. They excel at 
bashing and enhanced damage. Due to their size they are not good  swimmers
and cannot breathe under water easily.
~

0 TROLL TROLLS~
Used in stories to frighten children, in war stories to impress bar lasses
and as sources of humor in puppet shows, the troll is always a villain for
the "civilized" world.  Standing well over the tallest human, their
monstrous looks and unclean smell have earned them this image.
        Living in the high mountains, the troll has grown used to the cold
sterile air and dangerous heights.  Being some of the most hearty of many
of the races, few wounds ever are deep enough to cause long term damage to
a troll.  Though the fact brings much fear into human infantry, it is now
well known that fire and acid cause great damage to these creatures.
        Due to their nature, all trolls are evil.  And because of their
lack of proper learning, they are often to dull to become learned in the
ways of magely sorcery.  They are among the strongest of all the races,
and often the most deadly.
~

0 DRACONIAN DRAC DRACON~
Draconians are some of the foulest creatures that inhabit the planet. 
They scavenge bodies left on the battlefield for little trinkets or useful
items that they might wear. They are intelligent and strong but not very
fast. Some of the deadliest people to walk the land have been draconians
who have excelled in the ways of magic. Due to the wings on their back 
they are capable of flight. They are about 5' tall. They are resistant to
poison and disease. They must remain evil or risk losing all that they
have
learned.
~

0 GNOME GNOMES~
The smallest sentient species in the land, averaging 3' in height, 
Gnomes are usually pale grey to light brown skinned, and see in 
the dark with infravision. Tough, wiry little cretures, Gnomes 
live a long time and accumulate wisdom and knowledge. Resistant 
to poisons, they are vulnerable to bashing. Gnomes walk in all
paths, good, neutral, or evil.
~

0 ILLITHID ILLITHIDS~
An Illithid is a medium-sized humanoid with an octopuslike head, and
lengthly, tentacled hands. Known more for their incredibly ability with the
less martial, Illithids possess psionic abilities, are telepathic, and
possess a keen mind when it comes to the ways of magic. Their skin usually
ranges from a deep purple to the odd green, giving them an unwholesome alien
look. Their lunkish figures make them less adept in combat, but they are most
certainly some of the strongest minds in Thera.

Illithids, with such odd hands, are unable to make use of normal weapons and
shields, but instead use their tentacles in combat with good effect. Weak to
the pains of both light and fire, the mindflayer Illithids are quite
resistant to both magic and mental attacks, providing them with excellent
durability against other magely forces. 

These creatures, as scholarly and secretive as they are, are inclined to take
up the studies of necromancy, channeling and elementalism, dismissing the
more brutish classes as uncivilized and weak.
~

0 ETHEREAL~
Ethereals origins and species progression is unknown.  They do come from
another plane, possibly a wizard summoned them and lost control and they
started to reproduce on this plane.  They have no discernable body or
mass, simply a floating mist which makes them highly resistant to weapons
but electricity is a big weakness of theirs due to the water particles
present in their form.  They can fly and are some of the best minds in the
world.  They are more akin to mage professions than fighting.  They must
be good or neutral.
~

0 FORAGE~
Syntax: forage

Lets a ranger in a forest search for edible berries.
~

0 'RANGER STAFF'~
Syntax: cast 'ranger staff'

   Creates a powerful staff that a ranger can use to fight his or her
opponents with. It has a chance of healing in combat as well.
~

0 RANGER RANGERS~
Outdoorsmen, hunters, masters of woodcraft, Rangers are the guardians of
the forests.  In addition to having excellent fighting skills, they are
also wielders of some powerful magic.  Some Rangers have been known to
call large bears, lions, wolves and falcons to their aid, fashion mystical
staves, and be able to camouflage beyond detection.  Their ability to
ambush opponents makes them deadly foes.
~

0 WARRIOR WARRIORS~
Warriors live for the combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best 
fighters of all the current classes but lack the subtle skills that others
possess. They possess no magical talent whatsoever and rely on brute 
strength and combat know-how instead.
~

0 CLERIC CLERICS~
Clerics are the most defensively oriented of all the classes.  Most of
their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat
spells being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are
the best class by far at healing magics, and they possess an impressive
area of protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.
~

0 CHANNELERS CHANNELER~
Channelers are the local sponges, not a very outstanding title but one
which they bare with much pride. These select few have been chosen by
the gods to absorb the excess powers of the world and redirect them for
their use at their descrection. It has been said that a channeler can
stand face to face with a dragon and absorb his fireballs as if they
were not there, and then to shoot them back at the dragon with even more
power then they were originally formed.
~

0 NECROMANCER NECROMANCERS~
Wielders of black magic, they study the darkest and most hated of all of
the
magical arts, that of giving life to something without any. In other words
raising the dead. It is said once a necro reaches a certain level of
efficiency with his spell weaving the dead themselves will heed his call.
~

0 ELEMENTALIST~
The elementalist seeks to harness and control the powerful forces
of earth, air, fire and water.  While lacking the sheer raw magical power
of the channeler, and the armies of servants of the necromancer, the
elementalist can tailor his powers to exploit the specific weaknesses of
the creatures of Thera.  The elementalist is the caller of earthquakes and
the summoner of tidal waves.  Truly adept elementalists can call upon
creatures from the elemental planes to serve them.
~

0 MONK MONKS~
Monks are martial artists dedicated to the understanding of
the body and the perfection of it into total control. Monks are adept
at unarmed combat and lose much of their skill when using weapons.
   A monk who fights hand to hand can get up to fourth attack,
but lose the ability to hit with third and fourth attacks when using
weapons. All monks are lawful due to their strict regime of meditation
and martial arts parctice. They can be either good or neutral.
~

0 THIEF THIEVES~
Thieves are a marginal average class. They do a few things better than any 
other class, but have a wide range of skills available.  Thieves are 
specialists at, of course, thieving, sneaking, and being unseen. They can
enter areas undetected where others can not. 
~

        Elementalist  - Controllers of the elements.
~

0 ANTI-PALADIN ANTI-PALADINS ANTIPALADIN ANTIPALADINS ANTI~
Little is known about the origin of the Anti-Paladins. However, it is 
clear that they came (in force) into the world shortly after the rise 
of the Paladins. It is rumored that these warriors of chaos and evil 
were traitor paladins, children trained by demons, or possibly even
demons themselves.

There have been those who have claimed to learn the secrets of these
"anti-paladins", but this is all most would reveal: It is said the
guild of Legion (which is claimed to be the true name of the AP's guild)
is similar to that of the monks. Young men and women of all races come
to the guilds in hope of learning to better themselves and harming the
world. Through years of training, the Legionaires learned to embrace
the ways of chaos and evil. It is this mindframe that allows them to 
unleash their dangerous magics upon Thera. There are stories that tell
of those who have left the guild to lead more peaceful lives, and found
themselves unable to use their former magics, their powerful skills, 
and even unable to walk or speak. 

It is unknown if these stories are true or false, however, one thing is 
clear. These mage-warriors want nothing more than the destruction of all
that does belong to them and their guild.  
~

0 PALADIN PALADINS~
These warriors have chosen the path of virtue and chivalry above all others. 
This dedication to their cause grants them priest-like spells and healing
powers.  They are also formidable fighters, always questing to stamp out
evil. Paladins must stay good in order to cast their spells.  Those who
forsake goodness are frowned upon.  Paladins are expected to be truthful,
chivalrous, humble, merciful, kind, bold, and noble of spirit.  Paladins
must be Lawful Good.
~

0 HOMETOWN HOME TOWN~
You must now choose your hometown. This is the town which you will
recall to when using word of recall, or whenever you die. Midgaard
is for all alignments. Ofcol is for good only, New  Thalos for neutrals
only, and Arkham for evil only.
            
New players should choose Midgaard as it is most central.
~

0 AGE~
Ageing is just that, a character getting older. In Tartarus your
characters will age slowly as you spend time exploring the world. The age
at which you die will vary depending on your race (the biggest factor),
your constitution and a small random factor.

When you eventually die of old age you will expire premenantly. Immortals
may be able to increase your lifespan if quests are undertaken.

Expect a human to live for around 400 hours of real time, other races are
variations on that, with some longer (elves are almost double), and some a
little shorter.
~

0 MORPH MORPHDRAGON~
Syntax: morph <color>

This allows a changeling to shapeshift into a dragon form. Colors
available are red, green, blue, black and white. In dragon form the
player can use the 'breath' command to send forth a blast of dragonbreath

Morphing is enabled only for immortals in the stock mud. 
See also: 'help shapeshift'

The other form currently supported is that of forming a third arm

wield (if they have the dual wield skill) and also to hold up to three

0 'ANIMATE DEAD' 'MUMMIFY' 'ANIMATE SKELETON' ANIMATE DECAY 'DECAY CORPSE'
'EMBALM' SOULBIND SOUL~
Syntax: cast 'animate dead' corpse
	cast 'animate skeleton' skeleton
	cast mummify corpse
	cast decay corpse
	cast preserve corpse
 	cast soulbind <target>

These are the basis of a necromancer's power. Decay corpse strips the
flesh off a corpse and leaves the skeletal remains. The skeleton may then
be animated using the 'animate skeleton' spell.

Corpses that are still intact may be animated with the more powerful
animate dead spell, or, at much higher levels, raised as mummies with the
mummify spell.

'Embalm' skill will preserve a corpse and extend the duration before a
it decays to dust.

In all cases of animates the undead raised will have a level of power
comparable to it's living existence but slightly lowered. Thus an orc
zombie won't be as powerful as a demon zombie. Skeletons are weaker than
zombies, which are in turn weaker than mummies. The number of undead you
can raise is level dependant and also modified by the type of undead you
already have following you.

attempt to dual wield it. (This is provided that they are not using a
light, shield or held item which would occupy their other hand).

Trinal wield is a bit different. It requires a changeling who has

0 OOCTELL~
Syntax: ooctell (character) (message)
This is a command used to separate Roleplaying from out of character
communication. You may use this for various questions to imms or other
characters that can not be asked in character. However, this will not be
used as a venue to curse at players when you are upset etc., that kind of
behavior will be severely punished. Also overuse of this command will be
looked down upon by immortals so if you want to make something out of the
character you are playing, use OOCTELL sparingly.

creatures and where murder and destroyed, for the most part. In modern days
wood-elves are still rare but do exist as ancient folk lore tells us. Wood-elves

-1 LAG~
Twas dial-up, and the failing mudders did toil and struggle in the fray
All checksummed were the compressed files
And the man pages, outdate
Beware the Internet my son,
The noise that hangs, the lag that kills
Beware the Usenet news, and shun the frivolous mud with frills
So took his his mudding client in hand
Longtime the virtual foe he sought
So rested he by the T1s three and paused a while in swap
And as in disk-drive swap he stayed,
The Internet, with lags of fame
Came packetwise through the T1 line
And error-checked as it came
One two one two and through and through, the mudding client went kill -9
He left it dead and with it's core he went a tracing back
And hath thou slain the Internet?
Come to my arms my disk-based bot!
Oh lag-free day, callooh callay, he chortled in his joy
Twas dial-up, and the failing mudders did toil and struggle in the fray
All checksummed were the compressed files
And the man pages, outdate.

-1 ROM~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,  
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code.
It will be found at hypercube.org 6666, when it is opened.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files
ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the
release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (enchant armor, the new poofin/poofout), and many
contributions and ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of Rusty's
code from Moosehead also remain.

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)
~

-1 IMMORTAL IMMORT GOD WIZARD WIZ~
'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 52
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)

-1 MAP MAPS~
Thanks to Ezra for drawing the originals of several maps on ROM.

52 JOBS~
This is a partial list of what a god of any given level should be doing. It is
not complete yet.

Angels:(52-54)
Angels and higher level gods may not assist mortals directly in any way.  
An Angel's main job is to help with quests (via switch), or possibly run
small quest of their own -- but the rewards should be minimal.

Deities:(55-56)
Deities have two main roles: reimbursement and quest running.  Be skeptical
on reimburses, don't just hand out every piece of gear.  I suggest limiting
reimbursements to 10 items at a time, and make sure that you do not load things
at too high a level (new format items have hard-coded levels, so are not a
problem).  vnum and stat are useful for this.  You can draft Angels to help you
run a quest, and please note that quests should NOT have huge rewards -- the
main point should be to have fun.  Deities have no business trying to enforce
rules -- the most you should do to a player is a NOCHANNEL or similar light
punishment.

Gods:(57-59)
Gods can run quests just like Deities, and it's nice to do reimbursements too.
However, the main role of a God is keeping the peace.  Gods can enforce (but
not create rules), using the various NOTELL-class commands, as well as deny,
purge, freeze, and ban (but be careful with these commands!)  Gods are expected
to help make the mud run more smoothly, power trips are strictly verbotten.

Not fulfilling the roles of your office can result in demotion or deletion.
~

0 SUICIDE DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.
~

0 HEALER~
The healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some
services are still free to players of level 10 or below, however.  To see
a full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To
receive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.
~

-1 GAIN~
The gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has 
been found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:

gain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned
gain points:  lower your creation points by 1 (costs two sessions)
gain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain convert: turns 10 practices into one training session

Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see 'help train')
Gained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total
number of creation points. 
~

52 CLONE~
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~

0 SKILLS SPELLS~
The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list
of available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in
order of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)
listed where applicable.
~

0 OUTFIT~
The outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), 
courtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.
~

0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT~
ROM uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac	  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassit : makes you help group members in combat

Typing a command sets the action , typing it again removes it.

- These are the cabals (Ka-ball), offered to mortals
on Winds of Hope. A cabal is a special group or "House"
of players who's roles are similar. For more help or
information in one specific cabal see that cabals help
file (Ex: 'help rager').

A few things that WILL get you blackballed from any cabal
are:
1. Lying to an Immortal or Leader about your hours, skills,
equipment, or experience.
2. Applying for a cabal Ex: Enforcer, after being in its
enemy cabal.
3. Full looting, Killing, or Raiding a cabal or cabals
player will keep you from that cabal.

These rules are set to keep 100% assholes out of cabals.

~

-1 'MENU CHOICE'~
Choice (add,drop,list,help)?~

-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~
The ROM skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making
him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick
at character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are 
paid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the
harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to
practice.

Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells
that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a 
default skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced 
selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.

The experience breakdown is as follows: 
points   exp/level     points   exp/level
40        1000         90        6000
50        1500         100       8000
60	  2000         110      12000
70        3000         120      16000 
80        4000         130      24000
The table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.
~

-1 BASICS 'ROM BASICS'~
The basic skills:

Every character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a default
set that all characters receive.  The default skills are:

recall  	essential escape skill (see help recall)
scrolls		reading of scrolls and other magical volumes
staves		use of magical staves
wands		use of magical wands

for class defaults, check the classes themselves.
~

-1 MAGE 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' 'MAGE DEFAULT'~
Mages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.
Mages have the highest-powered magic of any class, and are the only classes
able to use the draconian and enchanting spell groups.  They are also very
skilled at the use of magical items, though their combat skills are the 
weakest of any class.

All mages begin with skill in the dagger. Any other weapon skills must be
purchased, at a very high rate.  The default skill selection for mages is
as follows:

skills:
lore		the lore of magical items

spell groups:
beguiling	spells that control the mind
combat		offensive magics, such as fireball and chill touch
detection	informational magics, such as detect magic and identify
enhancement	spells that maximize physical potential, such as haste
illusion	magics for concealing and deceiving
maladictions	a selection of curses fit for any witch
protective	defensive magics, ranging from armor to stone skin
transporation	spells for getting from here to there
weather		spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~

-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' 'CLERIC DEFAULT'~
Clerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells
being far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best 
class by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive area of
protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

All clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield skills must
be purchased, many at a very dear cost.  The default skill selection for 
clerics is as follows:

skills:
flail		the proper use of flails

spell groups:
attack		a selection of offensive magics
creation	the making of physical objects, such as food and water
curative	spells that cure the sick and feeble of their ailments
benedictions	powerful magics that grant the blessings of the gods
detection	informational magics, such as detect magic and identify
healing		spells for treating wounds, from scratches to death blows
maladictions	an assortment of curses
protective	defensive magics, including the powerful sanctuary spell
transportation	spells for getting from here to there
weather         spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
~

-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' 'THIEF DEFAULT'~
Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at
thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than
clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.

All thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as 
well.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection
is chosen.  This default skill package includes:

skills:
mace		the use of maces and other blunt weapons
sword		swordplay and fencing
backstab	the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
disarm		used to deprive your opponent of his weapon
dodge		the best way to take a punch is not to be there
second attack	with training, the skilled thief can hit twice as fast
trip		a good way to introduce an opponent to the floor
hide		the art of remaining undetected in a room
peek		used to look into a person's belongings
pick lock	a useful skill for breaking and entering
sneak		with this skill, a thief can walk into a room undetected
~

-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' 'WARRIOR DEFAULT'~
Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.

Warriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat.
Other weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill
package, which includes the following:

skills:
weaponsmaster	this group provides knowledge of all weapon types
shield block	the art of parrying with a shield
bash		a forceful rush with the body, designed to flatten your foes
enhanced damage	this skill multiplies your damage in battle
parry		the art of parrying with weapons
rescue		allows you to take the blows aimed for a companion
third attack	allows the skilled warrior to land three blows in one round
~

-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~
Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.
If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.
The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at 
both his weapon and his opponent's.

The weapon skills consist of the following:

weaponsmaster	skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)
axe		the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)
dagger		the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons
flail		skill in ball-and-chain type weapons
mace		this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces
polearm		the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds
spear		this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms
sword		the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore
whip		the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips
exotic		the use of strange magical weapons

The exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.
~

-1 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block, but only warriors and
clerics are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts, and
whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split shields in two.
~

-1 ATTACK~
The attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine energy
rather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They are less powerful
than the combat spells, but can still deal out a stinging blow.  Mages and 
thieves cannot use this group.  The attack spell group consists of the 
following spells:

demonfire	a powerful, but very evil, spell
dispel evil	torments evil foes
dispel good	calls down unholy power on good creatures
earthquake	brings the power of earth to bear against your foes
flamestrike	sends a column of flame from the heavens
heat metal	heats metal equipment to searing tempatures
ray of truth	sends forth a blinding ray of holy energy
~

-1 BEGUILING~
This insideous spell group is used to invade the minds of others.  It consists
of various charming magics, well suited for turning your foes to your cause.
Only mages and thieves have access to the beguiling magics, which consist of
the following:

calm            if successful, stops all fighting in the room
charm person	turns an enemy into a trusted friend
sleep		puts a foe into enchanted slumber
~

-1 BENEDICTIONS~
Benedictions are priestly spells, used to bestow divine favor upon your allies.
They are often restricted to those of like alignment.  Only clerics and 
warriors may use these spells.  The benedictions spell group consists of the
following:

bless		bestows divine favor upon the target
calm		if successful, stops all fighting in the room
frenzy		puts the recipient into beserker rage
holy word	aids your allies while calling divine wrath upon your foes
remove curse	removes malevolent magic from players and items
~

-1 COMBAT~
These sorcerous spells are, in the words of one famous mage, just 'more ways to
toss energy around'.  They are the most powerful of the damaging spells, and
considered an essential part of most wizards' collections. Clerics and thieves
do not have access to these spells.  In order of power, the combat spell group
contains the following magics:

magic missile	send a weak energy bolt into a foe
chill touch	weakens your enemy with a frigid grasp
burning hands	sends a blast of fire into your foe
shocking grasp	sends a powerful jolt into a foe
lightning bolt	sends forth a single bolt of lightning into an enemy
colour spray	blasts your opponent with a rainbow spray, which may blind him

~

-1 CREATION~
The creation spell group is used to create objects, of temporary or permanent
duration.  Skill creators can travel without food or drink, and use their 
powers to create nourishment as required.  All classes may become learned in
this group, which contains these spells:

create food	produces a nourishing mushroom
create rose	creates a beautiful red rose
create spring	calls forth a small but pure spring from the ground
create water	fills any available container with water

~

befall an adventurer.   For healing of damage, see the healing spell group.
Curative spells cannot be used by mages or thieves.

cure blindness	restored sight to the blind
cure disease	heals the plague
cure poison	removes the harmful effects of poison
~

-1 DETECTION~
The detection spells have may uses, all related to gathering information. They
can be used to see hidden objects, give information about treasure, or even
scry out the true nature of your foe.  All classes except warriors can use 
detection spells.

detect evil	reveals the aura of evil monsters
detect good	similar to above, only for good monsters
detect hidden	shows the whereabouts of hidden foes
detect invis	allows the caster to see the unseeable
detect magic	reveals magical auras to the caster
detect poison	determines if food is safe to eat
farsight	searches for living beings near the caster
identify	gives information about the nature of an object
know alignment	determines the moral character of a monster or person
locate object	finds a specific item
~

-1 DRACONIAN~
The Draconian spell group deals with the magic of dragons -- in this case, 
bringing forth the devastating power of their breath weapons upon your foes.
Only mages have the mental training necessary to cast these spells, and few
of them ever reach the level of mastery required to use them.

acid breath	 uses the black dragon's attack upon an enemy
fire breath	 calls forth the flames of a red dragon
frost breath	 drains the life from a foe with the power a white dragon
gas breath	 suffocates your enemies with poison gas
lightning breath summons the electrical fury of a blue dragon 
~

-1 ENCHANTMENT~
The enchantment spell group is used to imbue items with magical properties.
Currently, this spell group consists of enchant weapon and enchant armor, 
although more will be added in the future.  Only mages may enchant.

enchant weapon	increases the hit and damage bonuses of a weapon
enchant armor	increases the protective value of armor
fireproof       shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid
recharge	restores power to a depleted wand or staff
~

-1 ENHANCEMENT~
The enhancement spells improve upon the body's pontential, allowing feats of
superhuman strength and speed.  However, these spells may often have harmful
effects upon the recipient.

giant strength	grants increased strength
haste		doubles the speed of the target, but slows down healing
infravision	allows monsters to be seen in the dark
refresh		restores energy to tired adventurers
~

-1 HARMFUL~
This spell group is the opposite of healing.  The harmful spells are designed
to tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally turn the body against
itself.  Only priests and warriors may use this spell group.
In order of power, the harmful spells are:

cause light	inflicts minor wounds on an enemy
cause serious	inflicts wounds on a foe
cause critical  causes major damage to the target
harm		the most deadly harmful spell
~

-1 HEALING~
The healing spells are used to cure the wounds that adventurers inevitably
suffer in battle.  For curing other conditions, such as poison, see the
curative spell group.  Only warriors and priests have access to this group.
In order of power, the healing spells are:

cure light	heals minor wounds
refresh		restores vigor to a tired adventurer
cure serious	heals wounds
cure critical	closes all but the worst wounds
heal		the most powerful healing spell
mass healing	casts a heal spell on each player in the room
~

-1 ILLUSION~
The illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery.  They can be
used to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party.  Currently,
the illusion group is very small, but it will be expanded in the future.
Only thieves and mages can cast illusion spells, which consist of the 
following:

invis		turns the target invisible
mass invis	turns the caster's group invisible
ventriloquate	allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth
~

-1 MALADICTIONS~
Maladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed to
cripple, inconvenience, or torture, rather than kill outright.  These spells
may be cast by any class.

blindess	strikes the target blind
curse		prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat
energy drain	drains experience and mana, while strengthening the caster
plague		causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death from plague
poison		weaker than plague, but often fatal
slow		slows your enemies down, reducing their rate of attack	
weaken		drains the strength of the target
~

-1 PROTECTIVE~
The protective spells are used to shield against harm, whether from spells or
physical attack.  They range from the weak armor spell to the sought-after
sanctuary charm.  Also included in this group are several spells for dispeling
hostile magics. Any class may use this group, which consists of the following 
spells:

armor		provides the target with an extra layer of defense
cancellation	a powerful dispel, used for removing spells from friends
dispel magic	removes spells from enemies, not as effective as cancel
fireproof	shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid
protection evil	provides defense from the attacks of evil creatures
protection good protects from the attacks of good beings
sanctuary	reduces all damage taken by the recipient by half
shield		puts a shimmering shield between you and your enemies
stoneskin	turns skin hard as stone, providing a huge armor boost
~

which are among the most useful in the game.

fly		allows the target to fly over nearly all obstacles
gate		transports the caster to the target

usable by all classes.

call lightning	summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right
control weather	changes the weather in the manner desired by the caster
faerie fire	surrounds the target in a glowing aura
faerie fog	reveals all hidden creatures in the room
lightning bolt	sends a bolt of electricity into the target

(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)
~

-1 BACKSTAB~
Backstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It 
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.
The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his
weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.
Only thieves may learn the backstab.
~

-1 BASH~
The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon
is not generally a wise idea.
~

-1 BERSERK~
Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~

-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may
learn this skill.
~

-1 DISARM~
Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves
and warriors may learn this skill.
~

-1 DODGE~
In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.
~

-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~

-1 ENVENOM~
The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to
win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison 
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates 
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
~

-1 'HAND TO HAND'~
Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this
style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.
Clerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages
may also learn it.
~

-1 KICK~
Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters
and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn
it.
~

-1 PARRY~
If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~

-1 RESCUE~
A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~

-1 TRIP~
Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will
find the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.
~

-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~
Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes
in combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
round.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a 
very hard time with it.
~

-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~
Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect
third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly
skilled thieves may learn this skill.
~

-1 HIDE SNEAK~
Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and
thieves may learn these skills.
~

-1 'FAST HEALING'~
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it
very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.
~

-1 LORE~
Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
concerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value
of an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may
learn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard
to use.
~

-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~
Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although other classes may learn it as well.
~

-1 PEEK~
The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are
harder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most
common practicioners.
~

-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~

-1 MEDITATION~
This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have
much trouble learning to meditate.
~

-1 STEAL~
Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters,
and even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers gaurd their merchandise 
carefully, and attempting to steal from a character earns you a THIEF flag
if you are caught (making you free game for killing).
~

-1 'DETECT GOOD'~
Syntax: cast 'detect good'
 
This spell enables the caster to detect good characters, which will
reveal a characteristic golden aura.
~

-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~
Syntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>
 
Dispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on 
the pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their
peril.
~

-1 'RECHARGE'~
Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell
is proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be
recharged one time successfully.
~

-1 'DEMONFIRE'~
Syntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>

Demonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those
who follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to 
inflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.
~

-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~
Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>

Ray of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth
a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants
of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike 
casters who are tainted by evil.
~

-1 'PORTAL'~
Syntax: cast 'portal' <target>

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are
entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot
be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.
Portal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the
secret of this material component has been lost...
~

-1 'NEXUS'~
Syntax: cast 'nexus' <target>

This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus 
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...
~

-1 'HEAT METAL'~
Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>

Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary 
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).
This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.
~

-1 'HOLY WORD'~
Syntax: cast 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with
disasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful
blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of
opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)
are struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and 
drained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.
~

-1 FRENZY~
Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, 
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's 
alignment.
~

-1 CALM~
Syntax: cast 'calm' 

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is
the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence 
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who
are immune to magic) or none is.
~

-1 HASTE~
Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the slow spell. (see 'help slow').
~

-1 SLOW~
Syntax: cast 'slow' <target>

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism.
~

-1 PLAGUE~
Syntax: cast 'plague' <target>

The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.
~

-1 'CREATE ROSE'~
Syntax: cast 'create rose'

A romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game
use whatsoever.
~

-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL'~
Syntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>
	cast 'protection good' <target>

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry both defenses at the same
time.
~

0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>
 
This spell increases the strength of the target character.
~

-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~
Syntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>

Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning
that arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully
expended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members 
of a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other
viable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on
groups of creatures.
~

-1 FARSIGHT~
Syntax: cast 'farsight'
	cast 'farsight' <direction>

The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her
to see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense
concentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.
The spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in
all directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much
farther away.
~

-1 MASS HEALING~
Syntax: cast 'mass healing' 

The mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell
on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.
~

-1 'FLOATING DISC'~
Syntax: cast 'floating disc'

This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caser
around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight
penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and
usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a 
maximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location
on the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it
to run out of energy.
~

-1 FIREPROOF~
Syntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
~

-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~
Syntax: alias
	alias <word>
	alias <word> <substitution>
	unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with 
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument 
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.
~

-1 TARTARUS~
Tartarus code was started in late 1996 and completed around mid 1997. It
was developed at darkmists.mudservices.com for use on the mud Dark Mists
and used Rom2.4b3 code. The original coder on the mud was Thrym who
began the mud with Styx, who contributed ideas and help. Ceran joined
the team and contributed most of the core code, including all the class
and clan skills/spells as well as the majority of fully new code, before
leaving in 1997 because of conflicts with the other immortals.

This code release is named Tartarus and contains Ceran's original coding
plus rewritten code. This code is for use on Rom2.4b muds, although it can
be easily hacked for parts to use on other code bases. It is provided
solely for the MUDing community as a way of giving back to it what has
been freely given many times before.
The following people contributed to the Tartarus release:

Code --
	Thrym who installed the MOBProgs patch into the base ROM code.

Areas --
	-Lilith (Arkham) (Unable to contact this person. See 
         README.tararus file which comes with this derivative code)
	-Kay, who wrote a lot of Nightfall and Thorbardin.
	-Zenan, who did Rakshasa Domain when I got bogged down with code
         and other areas.

0 'LAWS' 'LAW'~
The Law of the Enforcers:
 
1.  There will be no attacking/slaying within any protected areas. This includes
the cities of Midgaard, New Thalos, Tar Valon, Ofcol and the Halls of Enforcer.
 
2.  Looting the corpse/pit within a protected area is against the law.
 
3.  Assisting criminals in any way is against the law. This includes, but is not
not limited to: Sancing, healing, rescuing, bandaging, grouping, assisting.
 
4.  Attacking an enforcer while hunting a criminal is considered under the same
ruling as law #3.
 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> RAIDING <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
 
Enforcers at this point in time will only actively raid the maelstrom's of chaos. This
does not mean that we do not have to enter other protected regions on account of
criminals that go into hiding.  In these scenerio's, we are after the said criminal
and not the respective item held to your cause. Should you choose to harbor the
criminal then you accept the warrent for your death.
 
If we hold an item of your respective cause, speak to an Enforcer who is present
that you may come announced to retrieve your own item, and keep the book of laws
safe for the realms.
