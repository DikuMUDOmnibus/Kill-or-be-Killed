In the foyer of a stone building~
You find yourself standing at the entrance to a large stone building. Unlike
most buildings in the ruins this one has been restored and kept in reasonable
condition. Large sticky globs of some fluid line the walls and floors, and
a disgusting smell fills the air. To the east and west you can see that the
corridor heads towards a pair of balconys overlooking the main entrance here.
South of here is a door leading out to the ruins.

You are standing at the southern end of a wide stone corridor. Sticky
green fluids and ichor drip off the walls and an awful stench reeks in the
air. A wide, slime encrusted stairwell heads up into the building.

On a large stairwell in a building~
You are standing on a large, wide stone stariwell. The steps are slippery
and slick with strange green ichor and thick sticky slime. Heavy breathing
and disgusting sounds of eating can be heard echoing all around you. There
are small alcoves in the stairwell in all directions, while the stairs
themselves head up and down.

You find yourself in a small chamber off of the stairwell heading up and
down in the building. Putrid, decayed corpses of some unidentifiable
creatures lie upon the floor and smaller body parts are stuck in the slime
and ichor clinging to the walls. You can only go south to the stairwell.

In a slime encrusted corridor~
The corridor here is filled with thick warm mucus and green bile. It looks
like dozens of huge mouths have been drooling their saliva onto the floor
and walls for days on end. There is also an almost deadening stench of
something vile and despicable. The corridor heads north to some wide stairs
or south to a doorway.

breathing of some horrible beasts on the other side. The corridor itself

Above a large stairwell~
You are standing at the top of a stairwell amidst a virtual lake of disgusting
beholder excretions. The stench from here is overwhelming and you can barely
breath as it rises around you in steaming wafts. To the west is a large open
space that almost looks like it's a pool of exrection and waste. The stairwell
leads back down.

In a well furnished room~
This room has all the trappings of a lords bedroom. It is spacious and very
expensively decorated. It looks like something other than just foul beholder
beasts live in this tower. There is a door in the west wall leading out to
the corridors.

In a dark room of arcana power~
This room has the feel of supressed violence and magical forces waiting to
be released. Despite the vileness of the room there is something almost making
you feel in awe of the power that is building up in here. The only exit out of
the room is to the west through a door.

In a bare room filled with rubble~
This room hasn't been restored like the rest of the building. There is a pile
of rock and debris dumped in here, indicating that much of the clean up ended
up being deposited in this room rather than carried all the way outside. There
is a door in the east wall leading out into the corridors.

The prisoner's room~
This bare room is mostly filled with rocks and derbis left over from the clean
up of the building. Some strong manacles hang off the west wall and pools of
thick blood and torn black fur are scattered around the room.

In a slime encrusted room~
The room is totally drenched in the foul smelling liquids of beholder drool.
There is nothing in the room untouched by the sticky green substance, and you
can barely see through the steaming mist rising from the warm mess. There is
a door leading west into the clean aired corridors.

A room of foul smelling vapours~
This room is filled with the smell of disgusting beholder matter. There is
little of real interest in it however, and you can barely breathe while in
here. The best way out is the door in the east wall.

The Dark Room~
This room is dark, with no lights at all within it. It is like some kind
of shrine to the night. The only thing you can see of interest is a lage
iron door in the north wall.

In a hall of beholders~
You stand ankle deep in the sticky green excretions of a massive number of
beholders. The room is filled with thick steaming gas as it rises from the mess
on the floor, and you find it hard to breath. All around you there is the sick
sound of heavy laboured breathing. The halls head north, east and south.
