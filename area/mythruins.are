A cold and dark prescence forms out of the freezing air.

When the last of the elves had fallen in Myth Drannor the ancient evil that
had been buried beneath it arose to return to the world. But there was still
another unforseen step required and the darkness, while searching for that
last piece, required servants to guard It. The last elf king of Myth Drannor
was one of these, and now his spectre guards the way to the greatest evil.

In the ruins of the south gate~
You stand before a pile of rubble marking the entrance to what looked to once
be a fabulous elven city. Remains of what was once great still linger even
here in the rocks and creeping undergrowth. The shattered archway leading
into the city bears the markings of elvish highlords of longpast. To the
east and west you can make out rock strewn paths around the city
battlements. South of here heads into the dark forests.

Under a broken archway~
Above you is a majestic but shattered stone archway. Intricately carved signs
have been cut into it, and fine gems still lie embedded on it's surface. If
ever there was an indication of an abandoned city this is it, gems left here
untouched by even common looters and scavangers that usually haunt ruins. To
the east the ruins open out into a large open space filled with swampish weeds
and wet muddy gorund. In the distant north you can make out the ruins of some
towers.

Walking through the rubbled ruins~
You are amidst the ruins of the ancient elven city. All around you the stones
have been crushed and scattered, left to erode with time. The greatness that
was once here is long since gone and only the fine delicate stonework gives
any indication of what once was. The ruins wind north towards some towers, or
south to what appears to be a large broken archway.`

Between the Towers of Passing~
You are standing in a large open space that appears almost as if maintained
and kept clear. The rubble and overgrown forest flora seems to have avoided
this region, and the destruction is more subdued here. Three towers lead off
from the square here: a green tinted one to the north, blue tinted to the
east and a blood red one to the west. The rubbled ruins lead southwards
away from here.

Before a tower of Blue tinged stone~
You are standing at the entrance to a small but conspicuous tower. Unlike
the rest of the ancient city this tower appears to be in almost perfect
condition. The wind here seems stilled and unnaturally quiet, not even the
sound of your own footsteps seems to reach your ears. A large stone door
tinged with some strange blue colour blocks the way east into the tower.

On a crumbling bridge over a black river~
You stand on a wide but decayed stone bridge. Large portions of the span have
collapsed into the stagnant black waters beneath it, leaving huge holes that
threaten to swallow any who venture too close. To the south the ruins seem
to have become swamped with water and covered in marsh-like flora. North of
here there is a pile of rubbled ruins, most of which is impassable, but a
small section can be seen cleared away to allow some exploration.

Before a bloody signpost~
Here in the middle of the marshy ruins there is a large wooden sign covered in
dried blood and adorned with blackened and cracked skulls. The ruins to the
north of this sign seem ominous and less disturbed than to the west, and you
notice that almost all the tracks lead out from the north, rather than into it.

At a junction in the swampy ruins~
The wet marshlands that have grown here in the ruined elven city are almost
completely taking over the land. There is very little sign in this part of the
city of what once was, and the way through is blocked by the dense swamp muck
and deep holes of water. There is a wide, cleared path leading east, and a
darker path heading west. To the south the swamps seem to recede a little.

Walking through the swamp drowned ruins~
The ground here is like a normal swamp...wet, muddy and stinking. There is
almost no signs of the ancient city that once held power in this region, and
it's almost as if it never had been here. This swampy region is the most
blatantly obliterated part of the entire elven city.

To the south you can see one of the harbours of Myth Drannor, filled with a
shallow blood red water that laps continuosly upon the ruined harbour. The
salty smell of blood fills the air, and there is something powerful and
disturbing about the way the region seems locked in time. It is as if the
bloodshed of the elves were only yesterday and not centuries ago. There is a
ruined boathouse to the north, or you can walk east across the docks. West of
here lie the marshlands of the Drannor ruins.

To the south you can see one of the harbours of Myth Drannor, filled with a
shallow blood red water that laps continuosly upon the ruined harbour. The
salty smell of blood fills the air, and there is something powerful and
disturbing about the way the region seems locked in time. It is as if the
bloodshed of the elves were only yesterday and not centuries ago. You can walk
east and west across the docks, or head south into the shallow blood red
waters of the harbour.

the murky river. None show signs of corrosiion or decay as you would
expect after centuries in the water, and some even appear to almost have
flesh still hanging off them. It is as if the region were preserved as it
was on the day that the massacres occured. The river heads east where you
can make out a large embankment of bones sitting high upon the river, or

restored from the destruction. The stone building shows the signs of massive
damage that everything else shows, but it has been restored to an almost decent
level by someone or something. As you walk by the building your feet slip in
some thick, sticky fluid that gives off a terribly stench. A doorway leads
north into the building or you can go east, south or west around the rubble of
the city.

You are at the edge of the isle of bones where a huge pile has been
erected to totally seal of the river. There must be thousands of dead
elves left here to dam up the river, preventing the waters from flowing
out of the harbours of Myth Drannor, and keeping it forever in a state of
bloody waters. The bones around you seem to shift slightly, and it's like
being in an earthquake of bones. The isle heads back to the west, and
there is no way through the solid blockade to the east.

Here at the northern edge of the bone isle you can see the extent of the
massacre that must have occured centuries ago. Scores of large ships and
boats have been totally demolished and left to rot in the bloody, bone
filled waters. Burnt and blasted hulls litter the entire region, and
skeletons of elves hang lifelessly from the helms and bridges of them.
There is no doubt that the forces that blocked and slayed the elves as
they tried to flee were powerful beyond anything seen in recent times. The
smashed boat graveyard is too hazardous to explore, and you can only head
back south onto the isle of elf bones.
