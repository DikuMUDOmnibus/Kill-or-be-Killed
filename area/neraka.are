Ariakas the Dragon Highlord is seated on his throne here.

Highlord Ariakas is seated here, dressed in his ceremonial Dragonarmor. Something about the man makes you uneasy and afraid. On his head he wears the Crown, making him the most powerful being here ... or should that be mortal?

The draconian is clad in the white dragonarmor of Highlord Lucien, a strange irony. Besides the torches, the armor is probably the brightest thing in the entire compound. But the dark soul beneath the armor is not white -- nor does it care a damn about the light other than to stop it utterly.

Road to Neraka~
You are walking along a dusty, well-travelled road heading north and south. The hard-packed soil makes you think about how much traffic this place must be getting, and then you wonder about who is making all this dust and footprints. Ahead, to the south, you see something dark and massive looming on the horizon, and closer to you, there is a guard's tent.

You are walking along a dusty, well-travelled road heading south and west. The hard-packed soil makes you think about how much traffic this place must be getting, and then you wonder about who is making all this dust and footprints. To the east is a guard's tent. You can hear many shouts and cries from the village to the south.

A guard's tent~
This is a pretty bland tent ... white canvas, a desk, piles upon piles of paperwork, and a draconian. How exciting ... the exit leads west to the main road. You've got this urge to get out there as soon as you can, so you're not asked (or forced) to help with the papers.

Road to Neraka~
This is definitely a village road ... the footprints are everywhere and the path is beaten pretty badly. Patches of green and red blood soak into the dirt, evidence of fights among the draconians and other members of the army. To the north, you can get away from the evil surrounding this place, and to the south, you can see the northern gates.

Northern city gates~
So these are the northern city gates of Neraka ... one look at the masonry tells you that they were constructed hastily but with great attention to their strength. A massive blackened metal gate spans the gap between the grey stone walls, but it is swung wide open. To the east and west, you can see guard towers. North will take you back to the dusty trail, and south lies the village itself.

Inside the village of Neraka~
Just inside the northern city limits, you can see it all from here: the tent city, the thousands of draconians soldiers, the hundreds of Dragons, and the countless human, goblin, and minotaur mercenaries milling about, waiting for orders from their commanders. And in the center of the village, black and awful, is the Temple of Takhisis. Whenever someone comes to Neraka and they see the Temple, it never leaves their mind.

You are inside a Dragonarmy tent, hastily erected amidst the others. This is just one of the easily accessible, but there are others ... there are hundreds upon hundreds of others. The inside of the tent is fairly nondescript; it's a white canvas tent, with a small cot in the corner and a small footlocker for keeping spare rations and personal belongings in. The entrance to the tent is back east.

You stand before the Eastern Entrance to the Temple of Takhisis ... THE Temple of Takhisis. It is here that Takhisis is rumored to make her earthly home, and it is here where the link to her earthly power resides. Two enormous black pillars stand on either side of the gaping black doorway. They are inscribed with hundreds of evil and chaotic runes and images of the evil gods. A gigantic relief of The Five-Headed Dragon stands above the doorway, with her name inscribed below.

Outer corridor the the Temple~
You stand in the outer corridor of the Temple. Large black stone pillars support the dark stone roof that hovers above you, pulsing with evil. Looking out between the thick pillars, you can see the village of Neraka, and you can see villagers and soldiers alike milling about, glancing at the temple and looking quickly away in fear.

You stand just inside the Southern Entrance to the Temple. Sounds come from everywhere: the sounds of anguished cries, of cheering soldiers, of arguing leaders, of chanting monks. It all blends together too well, too perfectly. The massive stone walls surround you, and torches burn brightly in their sconces. To the south is the light of the outdoors, and to the north ...

Inside the Temple~
You stand just inside the Temple to Takhisis. The sounds of clerics praying and monks chanting fills the air more than anything. Acrid incense wafts through the air, assailing your nostrils with burning pain. Your heart is leaping inside your chest and you get the feeling that no matter whether good or evil steps through these doors, lowly peasant to Dragon Highlord, everyone feels the same upon entering this place of darkness.

Main room of the Temple~
You stand in the center of the Temple. All around you, you hear voices whispering in your mind, whispering sweet seduction. Monks chant all about you, and clerics utter their prayers to the Dark Queen. The stone walls and floor seem to absorb the light that the black torches are casting from their sconces on the walls. And in the center of this room is a massive black fountain of a headless elf, blood gushing from the neck, carved from the same stone. Dark stairwells lead above and below.

Inside the Temple~
You stand inside the Temple. Now all you can hear in the stillness is the beating of your heart. The chants stopped just as soon as you entered this short corridor. The north and south walls are just like all the others, solid black stone, but accentuated with doors. Faint light can be detected coming from underneath them, perhaps the burning of a candle. There are no torches in this part of the hallway; it plunges into shadows at about the same place where you ceased to hear the chanting prayers.

You stand at a landing of the twisted stairwell. The stairs continue upward, still looping around and around in sick circles, but there are also doors here, leading everywhere. This place is deathly silent. Something must be wrong for it to be this quiet here when down below the combination of sounds blended into a chaotic song. Large, silent black oaken doors lead everywhere, and the stairs continue upwards into blackness, and each of them has a plaque above it.

As you look around at the bleak, black walls, nothing comes into your mind as to why this is called the Corridor of Birth. This place looks dead, just like the rest of the Temple. A dark chant begins down the hall, startling you. South is the stairwell, and the corridor continues north.

Before the Black Altar~
You stand before a large altar, surrounded by black-robed mages. One of them places a metallic orb in the center of the altar and the mages touch hands. As they begin to chant, fear creeps up your spine into your head. The chanting continues and the fear grows stronger. Black bolts of energy flow from the touching hands of the mages until they all spark and touch the orb. Slowly, green-black ooze flows from the orb until it uncurls, revealing a small glistening lizard-like figure. It gradually stands and stretches, the chanting dies off, and the lizard is taken to a room to the west. You come to the realization that you have just witnessed the birth of a draconian.

A few other footprints lead down the hall, but a very few lead back to the northern door.

The hall is black, and from a narrow indenture in the top wall, blood trickles down the length of it, dripping down the walls, off the ceiling, and onto the floor, where your footsteps are sticky. A few other footprints lead down the hall, but a very few lead back to the northern door. There is more blood here, and the screams are so close they make your ears ring.

Before a black altar~
You stand before a black altar, covered in blood and gore. There are no signs of life anywhere but your own ... and that may change soon. Flesh and skin are tossed in the corners of the room, and organs are thrown into a large fire, making the room acrid and smoky. There is not a trace of bone to be found anywhere ... as if the skeletons were stripped of flesh and were taken elsewhere.

You stand before a circular altar, one that glows and hums with powerful forces. All about you are engraved runes and sigils, sparking with magic. Light spins in a ring in the ceiling, and on the floor it spins the opposite way. Strong magic is here, but it's magic that is unsided and neutral. Additional rooms stretch to the north and south, and the corridor leads back to the west.

Before a broken altar~
You stand before a wooden altar, one that was once mighty and strong, but now is broken. It looks as it it were crushed with a fist rather than with a weapon of any sort. Blood smears the impact site. Splinters have been cleaned up, but the altar still remains broken, a true testament to the kind of warrior that will rise quickly through the ranks of the Dragon Army. To the north and south lie small rooms.

Entrance to the Dungeon~
You stand at the entrance to the Dungeon. Screams of torment and agony issue from all directions, rebounding endlessly off the black walls. They are like no screams you have heard before. Other sounds come from all around, too ... whips cracking, shouts of guards, and splatterings. All of them are coupled with the screams of the tormented. You can go anywhere from here, but the most comfortable exit is back up to the main floor of the Temple.

A large entryway~
You stand inside a massive arched entryway to a large meeting hall. All about you stretches the antechamber, black and smoky. A bad smell wafts from the north, but it's nothing too strong. The entryway opens in all directions, and the stairwell leads back down to the lower levels of the Temple. Torches line the walls and columns of the antechamber, but it's still difficult to see. You can hear the sounds of soldiers and shouting from up north.

Meeting Hall Antechamber~
You stand in a large antechamber before a great meeting hall. The walls are high and the ceiling is vaulted, arching up in black waves that pulse with energy and evil. Darkness floats through the room passively, shadowing the light of the torches and thickening the strange haze that floats all about. A great presence can be felt from the north, one that shakes your soul.

A corridor before the Hall~
You stand in a large corridor leading from the antechamber to the meeting hall itself. It is a wide corridor indeed, and as you walk you hear and feel your footsteps echoing off the strangely curving walls and ceiling. The worry that you will be caught at this point in the Temple is long gone, replaced by an intense shudder in your body and soul. Perhaps not fear, truly ... more like forced respect.

Storeroom~
You stand in a great store room of magical items. Bookshelves line the walls, filled with tomes of power. Other shelves are here as well, filled with magical reagents and other things used for making potions. This room does not seem dark and evil at all; it just seems powerful. The stench of death does not pervade it.

A necromancer's learning room~
Here is where the most darkness is in this hall. This small room contains the dark books of black magic and necromancy. A black candle is inside an elven skull on a table here, but it isn't burning. Black flasks sit on the table, unlabelled and unused. This must be where beginners learn, for almost all of the books are not bound in skin and locked with magic and steel.

The Armory~
This is the armory where the Army of Takhisis keeps spare weaponry for training new soldiers and draconian hatchlings. The equipment is mostly iron, but some steel and stolen silver weapons line the walls. There is nobody practicing, but a guard keeps watch so that nobody sneaks in and steals the practice weapons. The broken altar is back to the south.

Practice room~
This room is filled with sweat and the stench of draconians. Practice dummies sit all about the room, all impaled and slashed in various ways. There is blood, too, spattered on the floor and walls, the result of battles to the death, combat where the strong are chosen from the weak ... and the survivors are the strong. Other than that, the room is fairly nondescript, and looks like the rest of the Temple compound. To the north is the broken altar.

Dragon egg storage room~
This room is a treasure trove at first glance, but as you look closer, you realize the sad truth. It is just a stockpile for stolen metallic dragon eggs, the dragon eggs of Paladine. Silver, gold, bronze, copper and brass, all are here, silent and unaware of the fate that awaits them: to become mere footsoldiers in the Army of Takhisis. The only sound here is the sound of the horrible chanting from the black altar to the west.

Draconian hatchling keep~
You stand in a room filled with draconians of all sizes, from newborn to full-grown. Every now and again, when the horrific chanting to the east ceases briefly, a black-robed mage will enter and place the newly created draconian down. All of these draconians are less than 6 hours old -- at that age they are trained to become soldiers, and a rare few that the mages select will become more mages, to keep the creation process, along with Takhisis' Army, alive.

Room of Unlife~
This is where the animation takes place. A few skeletons are wobbling about, being moved by some unseen force. No necromancers are here, no shadowy figure in black robes. A chill is evident in the room, one that has no feeling to it. Some of the more animated skeletons are picking up iron swords that lie in the corner and advancing on you.

This is true necromancer's work. Here, a few apprentices move back and forth, retrieving bones from one end of the room and taking them to the other, where more experienced necromancers assemble them and bind them together using black magic. The apprentices then take them to the east, and then continue to work. No animation is done here, though.

Entrance to the Hall~
You are standing under the blackened, arched entrance to the Dragon Highlords' Great Hall. Peering north through the haze in the room, you can see that the hall is large, long, and fairly wide, with six barred cells set into the eastern and western walls. Directly in front of you, there is a feeling of complete and utter hatred, evil, and malice.

In front of Lord Ariakas' Throne~
Before you rises the throne of Dragon Highlord Ariakas, commander of the Dragon Army of Takhisis. He has the favor of Takhisis and her respect. Unlike the other Highlords, the throne does not have a group of bodyguards around it, but there is a strong aura of magic all about the throne. With the favor of the Dark Queen, who truly needs bodyguards when magic will not betray you?

The throne is raised a bit off the floor to show her status. From behind her, thick smoke roils about, and above her, mighty, unseen eyes protect her.

From this point you can see Lucien's White Guard, and all of the other Highlords' thrones, including the highest throne of all ...

You stand in the great Meeting Hall of the Dragon Highlords. This is where the commanders of the Dragon Army of Takhisis come to hold audience with their Queen and to conduct official business. A thick, smoky haze is all around, as is a faint but horrible odor. The thrones are arranged about the room, as are contingents of bodyguards. It is difficult to see the other end of the hall through the haze.

In front of a Highlord's Throne~
How odd ... there is no throne here. Just an empty space where there should be one. As such, no bodyguards are here, but soldiers still crowd into this area, just to have a little more room in this hot, humid, stench-filled room. But no matter where they go, they cannot escape the ever-watching eyes of Takhisis, their one Queen.

In front of the Green Highlord's throne~
Before you is a green throne, throne of Fewmaster Toede, Dragon Highlord. Except now, reports have come in about his death at the hands of kender. This seat is open to the strongest in the Army who are willing to accept it and the danger that comes with it ... the danger of being assassinated in the middle of the night by a jealous officer's soldiers. The bodyguard still crowds around it, unaware of what has befallen their commander.

A Dragon's cage~
You stand inside a dragon's cage. The mist from the dragon's breath is what makes the Hall so foggy. The walls are thick and black, and the bars are wide enough to let something small, like yourself, through. Fear, dragonfear, assaults you as you enter, and the smell of the dragon alone would be enough to make that fear come alive. The only things your legs are willing to do are stand in fear, or flee back west.

The Dungeon~
You stand inside the Dungeon. Screams of torment and agony issue from all directions, rebounding endlessly off the black walls. They are like no screams you have heard before. Other sounds come from all around, too ... whips cracking, shouts of guards, and splatterings. All of them are coupled with the screams of the tormented. You can walk about the Dungeon freely for some reason ... there are no cells, and hardly any guards to disturb you. What kind of dungeon is this?

Streets of Neraka~
You stand on an intersection of the streets in Neraka. One leads north and south, the other east and west. East will take you outside the village, and west will lead you directly to the Temple. The wind is dusty and blows very little, though. A stifling heat oppresses the village, though the sky is black and the sun can barely be seen through the clouds.

A smoke-filled bar~
This makeshift bar has it all: smoke, ale, women, and drunken soldiers. >From the looks of it, this might be the only tavern open in the village -- but you know better. This is just one of the more convienently located for the soldiers who guard the temple. You might be able to make it to the bar if you're lucky -- and just in time to stop a fight and ask your order, here comes a serving girl.

Inside a small house~
This is one of the many small houses that was disrupted by the coming of the Temple and the Dragonarmy. Now the inhabitants cower in fear that sometime during the night, a group of drunken soldiers will come and slay them in a mad frenzy of bloodlust. The fear is well-deserved, as a bar is just to the north.

Beneath an arch~
You stand beneath a rather tall stone archway, designed to honor troops coming from the east. However, the troops, under the command of Highlord Lucien, never came, along with the Highlord. Treachery is suspected, but not certain. To the north and south are small gates where it looks like you can climb up into the arch itself, and the road stretches on to the east and west.

You walk on an east-west road that leads away from the Temple, which is to the west. Try as you might, the image of the foul black construction is etched in your mind and you cannot and will never forget it. To the east the road continues away from the Temple, as well as to the west, heading under a large arch.

You walk on an east-west road that leads away from the Temple, which is to the west. Try as you might, the image of the foul black construction is etched in your mind and you cannot and will never forget it. The road stops here abruptly, and the view is one of desolate arid wasteland. Nothing grows here; nothing wants to grow here.

At the base of an arch~
The base of the arch is thick and square-shaped, with a thick oak door wide open in front of you. A small ladder leads up into the top of the arch itself, or you can head back under the arch to the south. The shadow cast is refreshing for a moment, and then the hot wind picks up, coating you with dry dust.

You stand at a turn of one of the streets in Neraka, and there are small buildings around you. From here the image and feel of the Temple still loom deeply in your mind, and they probably always will. You are surrounded by noises, with loud banging to the north and a quieter sort of chopping to the east. The winding street continues to the west and south.

Behind a tent~
You stand behind a tent of a Dragon Army soldier. The flap is blowing a little in the hot wind, but the wind offers no relief in the hot sun. It just coats you with dry dust that sticks to your skin and dries out your mouth. You can duck under the flap to enter the tent to the west, or you can go back to the village streets to the east and south.

You walk still on a wide, cobblestone road through Neraka. To the east, like a hideous nightmare, looms the Temple. To the west, the road continues on to the guard gates. All about you, there are draconians, mercenaries, and a few citizens. They mill about in the heat and fear that the Temple generates. There is a feeling in the air of despair, hatred and terror, and they all emanate from the black Temple. The sky above is continually black, even during the day.

Burning trash dump~
Before you rises a large trash pile, burning wildly, sending a bad stench rising into the wind. The smell isn't really one of trash, though, it's more of a smell of decay and death. Then it hits you like the foul odor did: this isn't a trash dump, it's a crematorium for sacrifices to the Dark Queen.

The western city gates~
So these are the western city gates of Neraka ... one look at the masonry tells you that they were constructed hastily but with great attention to their strength. A massive blackened metal gate spans the gap between the grey stone walls, but it is swung wide open. To the north and south, you can see guard towers. West will take you into the encampment, and east lies the village, and the temple itself.

To the west and all around you are hundreds of tents, and the western gates are back to the east. Many of the tracks in the dust lead straight west, where you can hear shouting, and steam rises up from a tent.

A small ladder leads down to the base.

You are inside the massive grey mess tent, and it is indeed a mess. Food is strewn about chaotically, and many soldiers are eating hungrily at long wooden tables. You could probably sit down unnoticed and eat a meal as well, if you could stomach the food, whatever it is. It looks like a thin stew made of organ meats and other nasty things. It's even hotter in here than it is outside. The mess tent stretches out for quite some way to the west, and the entrance is back to the east.

You are inside a Dragonarmy tent, hastily erected amidst the others. This is just one of the easily accessible, but there are others ... there are hundreds upon hundreds of others. The inside of the tent is fairly nondescript; it's a white canvas tent, with a small cot in the corner and a small footlocker for keeping spare rations and personal belongings in. The entrance to the tent is back south.

You are inside a Dragonarmy tent, hastily erected amidst the others. This is just one of the easily accessible, but there are others ... there are hundreds upon hundreds of others. The inside of the tent is fairly nondescript; it's a white canvas tent, with a small cot in the corner and a small footlocker for keeping spare rations and personal belongings in. The entrance to the tent is back west.

The Neraka Armory~
This is the Neraka Armory. Before the Dragonarmy came, most of this man's income came from supplying passing travellers with light armor. Now it comes from the Highlords, who don't pay him nearly enough for making the difficult to make Dragonarmor, which he will only sell to a Highlord. Otherwise, he's making some light chain mail and the like for the passers-by that are lucky enough to survive the trip here.

The meat market~
You stand in a sparsely decorated room, one that smells of blood and raw meat. The butcher looks up at you for a moment, then goes back to his work. The offerings are slim here, as most of the fresher, higher quality meat has been bought or simply stolen by the Dragonarmy. The high prices are a result of this. A sign, smeared with blood, is posted on a wall.

The sign reads:

Due to increased demand for better meats prices have to be raised slightly. I apologize for this and I hope to lower them soon. Thank you for your continued business.~

You walk on a road that leads through the damned village of Neraka. You can see the black mass of the Temple from here. Try as you might, the image of the foul black construction is etched in your mind and you cannot and will never forget it. To the north and south, the road continues on.

Before the Temple~
You stand before the Temple and now you know what it is that you felt upon entering Neraka. It is the presence of an almighty evil, one that will stop at nothing to stop everything. You can see the Temple clearly from here, and you recognize with awe what it is that you see above the doorway.

Southern city gates~
So these are the southern city gates of Neraka ... one look at the masonry tells you that they were constructed hastily but with great attention to their strength. A massive blackened metal gate spans the gap between the grey stone walls, but it is swung wide open. To the east and west, you can see guard towers. Going south will take you into the encampment, and north lies the village and Temple of Takhisis itself.

Southern Road to Neraka~
You are walking on the southern road to Neraka. It is well-travelled and hardened from thousands of feet walking on it at once. Dust rises with each step that you take, resulting in a visible trail behind you. To the north, the Temple of Takhisis rises high up like an eternal shadow over the land, pulsating with intense immortal dread. To the south, the road continues on monotonously. Directly north, you see the city gates.

An empty building~
The only thing that you can see upon entering this building is a cobweb coated in yellow dust, abandoned long ago. The stone walls are bare, completely devoid of any markings or windows. Wind howls through the door, blasting you with dust. You get the feeling that you are the only one who has seen the inside of this building for a long time.

Southern path outside the village~
You walk on a narrow dirt path outside the village, riddled with holes and stones. It is travelled significantly less than the rest of the roads of Neraka, but they are still worn and hard. Not much activity goes on here, as the south seems more exposed to the elements than any other part of the area. The sun is hotter, the wind is stronger and the dust is drier, but nothing can take your mind away from the Temple, leering at you like a mirage.

You walk on a narrow dirt path outside the village, riddled with holes and stones. It is travelled significantly less than the rest of the roads of Neraka, but they are still worn and hard. Not much activity goes on here, as the south seems more exposed to the elements than any other part of the area. The sun is hotter, the wind is stronger and the dust is drier, but nothing can take your mind away from the Temple, leering at you like a mirage.

A destroyed building~
You stand amidst a small stone ruin of a building that must have once been some sort of apothecary's shop. Broken glass litters the ground, and the stones are colored, as if from dyes. A bad smell pervades the place, but it's the smell of burnt chemicals and reagents, not of flesh. Surprising, considering who did this. What's left of the door leads back to the south.

Inside a tent~
You are inside a Dragonarmy tent, hastily erected amidst the others. This is just one of the easily accessible, but there are others ... there are hundreds upon hundreds of others. The inside of the tent is fairly nondescript; it's a white canvas tent, with a small cot in the corner and a small footlocker for keeping spare rations and personal belongings in. The entrance to the tent is back east.

Inside the eastern city gates~
So these are the eastern city gates of Neraka ... one look at the masonry tells you that they were constructed hastily but with great attention to their strength. A massive blackened metal gate spans the gap between the grey stone walls, but it is swung wide open. To the north and south, you can see guard towers. East will take you into the encampment, and west lies the village itself.

You walk on a small dirt path outside of the village of Neraka. Dirt and loose stones litter the outside edge of the track. Dust blows up and swirls in the hot dry air, and small pebbles beat against the stone buildings and canvas tents. To the west lies the Temple, a beacon of despair and hatred in the world. To the east are a few buildings and hundreds of tents.

A dirty pub~
This place caters to all of the common soldiers and mercenaries in the army, simply because it is cheap and the ale is strong. A bartender stands behind the bar, running to and fro to replenish kegs and mugs for those seated at and standing around the bar. A few worn-out serving girls weave their way through the crowd to bring more beer and ale to the soldiers. Nobody pauses to look at you.

This massive pile of garbage and waste is the product of so many thousands of soldiers in one place at one time. It probably started out as the product of the pub across the street, but it has escalated rapidly into a full-fledged waste heap. There's no telling what kind of diseases are floating around in the air here.

An empty, ruined building~
You stand inside a hollow shell of a building. The back half has been shattered, and harsh sunlight pours in. A desk is in the back, along with a sign. A few signs are posted up on the walls still, the kind of signs that a bank would have. If this was the bank, then it was looted long ago. The gold and silver within probably went to fund the army. Back to the east is the door to the street.

A small ladder leads down to the base.

Streets of Neraka~

Try as you might, the image of the foul black construction is etched in your mind and you cannot and will never forget it. To the south is a place where the road intersects the eastern entrance to the Temple, and the road continues on to the north. A bar lies to the east, and shouts can be heard from here.

A filthy tavern~
This must be one of the dirtier taverns in Neraka, judging by the dirty people here. Draconians are passed out at the bar and on tables, and minotaurs are still drinking heavily. The bartender is easy to get to, once you start shoving and pushing your way in. He looks up at you with anger in his eyes. This must not be the most fun to be had in Neraka, working here.

A cell~
Inside this blackened, burned cell, you see utter horror. A prisoner is stuck in the wall, not in a hole, but in the wall itself. His screams echo down the stony corridor as his entrails are constantly torn out and replaced by unseen hands. Blood pours from his mouth towards the floor, but is caught by some invisible maw, drinking hungrily.

Then, magically, the flames on the prisoner are extinguished, his wounds are healed, and the fire begins to chew on his prisoner once more.

An almost liquid feeling invades your lungs every time you inhale, and then you realize that it really is liquid, and you are starting to itch all over. It gets harder and harder to breathe in here, but the prisoners continue to do so, even though they are nailed to the wall. You start to feel your lungs burning, too, and you have a fierce desire to escape west.

A cell~
A puddle is in the middle of the floor, leaking blood. A skeleton is crawling slowly away from it. Your first thought is that the man's flesh was stripped away with a necromancer's spell, but then you realize that the puddle is still alive, is still a breathing, living creature. The skeleton, now on its feet and moved by a will stronger than its own, forces itself back inside the puddle, and the man is whole. Whole, that is, until a cleaver splits his back open, and the skeleton tears its way free again.

You stand inside the cell of a tortured elf, screaming for mercy. His eyes have been stitched shut with thick, black string and he has been crucified upside down on the wall. There is no indication of any harm being done to him at all, but two small demons circle his head, screaming horribly. A third is constantly tearing apart the flesh of small living creatures, and throwing the entrails and blood on the elf's face. One of the other demons then licks all of it off.

A prisoner is suspended in mid-air by steel chains, while a fire burns underneath him, scorching him and filling the air with the smell of burnt flesh and hair. Two small demons cut off small pieces of his body and shove them inside the prisoner's mouth. His eyes are held open with magic, and his screams never leave his mouth.

A cell~
Inside this blackened, burned cell, you see utter horror. A prisoner is stuck in the wall, not in a hole, but in the wall itself. His screams echo down the stony corridor as his entrails are constantly torn out and replaced by unseen hands. Blood pours from his mouth towards the floor, but is caught by some invisible maw, drinking hungrily, and always satiated.

A cell~
You stand inside a charred dungeon cell, blackened and burned. It reeks of seared flesh and tangible pain. Your light falls upon metal shackles bolted securely into the wall, and as you look at many lumps in them, you realize in horror that the lumps are chunks of incinerated flesh burnt permanently to the shackles. Cries of anguish echo from everywhere in this cell.

In the Darkness~
You stand in the midst of an impenetrable darkness. It claims you and grasps you in an unholy way. The scent of the abysmal air and the rhythm with which it moves tells you that there is something down here, something huge and evil that is watching you, even in this darkness. You have an urge to leave this place now ...

A run-down supply store~
This store once was a haven for travellers who came this way, but now its just for travellers who are unfortunate enough to come this far. The store is dilapidated and running down, as is the old man sitting behind the counter. He barely looks up as you walk in. Something here could be of some use ... possibly.

You are inside a Dragonarmy tent, hastily erected amidst the others. This is just one of the easily accessible, but there are others ... there are hundreds upon hundreds of others. The inside of the tent is fairly nondescript; it's a white canvas tent, with a small cot in the corner and a small footlocker for keeping spare rations and personal belongings in. The entrance to the tent is back west.

You stand at the base of a fairly tall guard tower. It is made from grey stone, and its craftmanship shows signs of a quick build. It was probably built by the Dragonarmy when they moved in to occupy Neraka. You can head up into the guard tower itself, or back west to the city gates.

A small ladder leads down to the base.

One looks at you, shakes her head, and turns away to approach a human mercenary. After waiting for a bit, you begin to think that nobody wants to pay attention to you.

Dust rises with each step that you take, resulting in a visible trail behind you. To the north, the Temple of Takhisis rises high up like an eternal shadow over the land, pulsating with intense immortal dread. To the south, the road continues on monotonously.

Southern path outside the village~
You walk on a narrow dirt path outside the village, riddled with holes and stones. It is travelled significantly less than the rest of the roads of Neraka, but they are still worn and hard. Not much activity goes on here, as the south seems more exposed to the elements than any other part of the area. The sun is hotter, the wind is stronger and the dust is drier, but nothing can take your mind away from the Temple, leering at you like a mirage.

You could probably sit down unnoticed and eat a meal as well, if you could stomach the food, whatever it is. It looks like a thin stew made of organ meats and other nasty things. It's even hotter in here than it is outside. The mess tent continues through a flap in the tent to the west, and the entrance is back to the east.

You can hear the shouts of the mess hall from here. This room stinks badly and is hotter still than the rest of the tent. The "meats" that you see on small tables and in cloth sacks look more like severed body parts and entrails than anything. Maybe you should leave before you get sick all over the place and the cook decides to throw that in, too. The doorway is back east.

You walk on a road that leads through the damned village of Neraka. You can see the black mass of the Temple from here. Try as you might, the image of the foul black construction is etched in your mind and you cannot and will never forget it. The street bends north and west here.

Streets of Neraka~
You walk on a road that leads through the damned village of Neraka. You can see the black mass of the Temple from here. Try as you might, the image of the foul black construction is etched in your mind and you cannot and will never forget it. To the south the road bends, and to the west lies the outer corridor of the Temple.

Atop the arch~
You stand on the inside of the massive stone arch that was erected to honor the coming of armies from all directions. However, the work order got lost in paperwork and the arch was constructed at the wrong road. It was supposed to be built on the northern road into Neraka, since only one army would be coming from the east, that of Highlord Lucien, who still has not arrived in the village.

Northern Checkpoint~
This looks like a Dragonarmy checkpoint, but it's been deserted. The only thing left is a massive gate that's closed off, blocking the east-west road. It's unlocked and you could probably open it pretty easily. But never mind that -- it's not like the Army of Takhisis to leave something like this laying around. They're good at making things disappear -- far too good. There are tracks leading up to the gate and beyond it, but the gate shows no sign of ever having been opened recently. A high wall of stone extends to a steep rock face to the north and south, preventing any but the most skilled of thieves and assassins from getting past unnoticed, but the days of necessity for that are long gone.

The Forge~
You stand within the forge itself. Though the fires here have not been lit for years, the heat still rages on. It is almost unbearable, even though the heat is not physical. It is a heat of hate, of anger, of rage at being contained here. A dark presence invades your mind, and you get the distinct feeling that you are not alone and are being watched.
