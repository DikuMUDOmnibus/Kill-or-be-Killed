At a muddy track~
As you dry yourself from being wet from the waterfall you rub the water 
out of your eyes.  You see a large village before you.  You see tall grass 
and large huts lined together.  You look ahead and see a large stone at 
least 50 feet tall.  The track leads on to the west.

Grassy fields~
You begin to thwack the grass away as you descend down the hill into the 
Rager village.  You swat at flies and mosquitos as they try bite you.  You 
begin to smell the blood as you get closer.  You begin to hear the almost 
inaudible sound of clashing weapons.

Entering the village~
Entering the village you see massive beings and some small ones too.  All 
the races of Ji'vundis are gathered here to fight for one cause.  
Regardless of race they aid each other with bandages as they come in and 
out of the village.

Village road~
As you walk down the village you notice there is a massive pillar before 
you.  It colored completely black and it has many inscriptions on it.

Forge entrance~
Two iron doors wave openly leading into Grime's forge house.  You take a 
peak east and see a giant calling you over.  You see him pounding on an 
anvil with a large iron hammer.  The searing heat almost makes you faint.

Grime's forge~
Grime gives you his one-toothed smiled and nods.  He asks you if you want 
anything to.  He pulls out his assortment of weapons.  Among them are 
spears, daggers, swords, maces, axes, polearms, and whips.  The heat makes 
you extremely dizzy and you can barely differentiate between the weapons.

The brawling balcony~
You stand in a completely square room with weapons hanging from the walls.  
The room is rugged with beautiful rugs and carvings.  A large man stands 
in the middle with his arms crossed awaiting a challenge.  He looks you 
over, laughs, and nods.

The village shrine~
The weapons clashes and odors suddenly cease to exist.  This calm place is 
a place where the ragers come to pray for their fallen friends and to 
contemplate on life.  You see a noble priest smiling and offering aid to 
the broken ragers.  He smiles at you and asks you if you want anything.
