the ancient dracolich~
The massive skeleton of an ancient dragon rises in fury!
~
This massive dracolich was once one of the greatest red dragons ever to
live.  In death the greater lords of darkness gathered it's form and used
the most unholy of magics to animate the corpse into a new phase of
existence.  The mortal flesh was shed and only the skeletal form was
presevered.  It's mind was then gathered from the shadows and reinstituted
into the new form, allowing It to once again walk the mortal planes as a
major free-willed undead.  Now it serves as It's lord's main form of
transport, enjoying the privilages it gets from such a duty.

You stand on the edges of a lake of bubbling acid. What you thought was 
water gurgling softly from a distance was in fact some black acid 
boiling and bubbling in a huge lake. The only way from this place is back west.

Lost in a misty field~
These fields span an incredible area. They must've been once used for 
the town crops and animals, but now they are blighted and rocky. The 
mist embraces you with a cold chill as if trying to absorb you into the 
eternal devestation of the land. All around you shapes move decadently 
in the shadows.

A pitch-black tunnel~
Shadows flicker about you in the haze of your light and receeding echoes 
haunt your steps. The darkness encloses you in a cold embrace and only 
the sounds of your own breathing are here to keep you company...or is 
that a scraping sound you hear in the distance...

A small underground pool~
You stumble out into a broad open cavern.  Some of your light shines on a
pool of water that lies here stagnant and uninviting.  On closer inspection
you realise that the water isn't actually water but thinned out blood that's
seeped from the ceiling and walls to form a sticky wet puddle.

A pitch-black tunnel~
Shadows flicker about you in the haze of your light and receeding echoes 
haunt your steps. The darkness encloses you in a cold embrace and only 
the sounds of your own breathing are here to keep you company...or is

A dark cave leads into the ground here, but light doesn't seem to penetrate
more than a few metres.  From the east a howl of great anguish and loss
rides in on the chill winds.  The path leads east into the mountain range or
you can go down into the cave.

Before the bone gates~
The pathway through the mountains ends here at a huge set of gates made
of bone.  A pair of huge arching spines constitute the frame of the gate
while blackened and charred plates of over-lapping demon bone cascade down
to fill in the gate's body.  It is beyond comprehension what could sort of
creature could have had such bones.  The path leads north into the
mountains, while trough the gateway you can hear faint sounds of demonic
laughter....

Below a staircase~
You stand at the base of some winding stairs leading up while black
marble floors and walls surround you in dark opulance.  Along the walls
carved statues of some demonic beings stare back at you.  It looks like
someone has placed a lot of rescources into making this place appear rich
and elegant.  The only way out if north into a corridor of black marble, or
up the staircase.

On a small landing~
Grotesque carnage greets you on this platform: twitching bodies lie 
hazzardly strewn about, many of them unrecognizable as anything you have 
ever seen before. Something or someone has slaughtered them. On closer 
inspection you realise they are more of the dark creatures of the keep, 
and someone has been killing them, someone very powerful.

On a small landing~
The landing is littered with the corpses of unidentifiable creatures. 
Someone has been bust clearing a path through here for some reason. 
Above you a staircase winds up onto the keeps roof, while to the north 
something evil seems to be brooding.

Out on the roof~
You are outside on the roof!
With a gasp of relief you breathe in fresh air and smell the crisp cold. 
But before you can get too relieved a loud hiss erupts to the east of 
you further along the roof.

Antechamber to the shadowlord's room~
This darkened room reminds you of a crypt.  Nothing stirs, not even the
wind, and even cries of agony and despair seem muted and far off.  Statues
of the many of the greater demons and devils of the Abyss' 666 layers have
been erected here: Orcus, Demogorgon, Pazuzus, Asmodeus, Bael, Molok and
others stare back at you with such intensity you feel yourself cringing.  A
landing lies south and to the east a door blocks the way but not the
prescence of something unspeakable.

On the northwestern battlements~
You are walking on a thick stone battlement that surrounds the outer 
wall of the keep. The perpetual night blocks the surrounding mountains, 
making you wonder what sort of creature could possible stand watch in 
such darkness. A clicking, scraping sound can be heard approaching you...

A blocked passage way~
This end of the tunnel has been carefully blocked off by debris and rocks.
However, careful inspection shows that there are some parts of the cave
block that appear moveable in the western part of the tunnel. Back to the
east you hear the sounds of busy activity.

The dim yellow lighting reveals barrels of ale and old food scraps. This 
is obviously used to provide nourishment to the busy dwarves as they 
rush about preparing for some fight. A door leads east, while to the 
south the tunnel awaits.

The captains room~
The captain of the dwarves appears to have set up a make-shift

itinerarys are strewn all about. Seems like he's not much into neatness 
even if he does like to be meticulous. The door leads back west.

At a small campfire in the tunnels~
A small campfire has been lit here, smoking out the room but providing
light and warmth.  Cooked meat and mugs of ale have been discarded after
what looks like a filling meal.  Around you the equipment of some
adventurers has been piled against the walls, much of it of fine make but of
little practical use to any not learned in the item's ways.  The only
visible exit is back north to the tunnels.

Lost in a misty field~
These fields span an incredible area. They must've been once used for 
the town crops and animals, but now they are blighted and rocky. The 
mist embraces you with a cold chill as if trying to absorb you into the 
eternal devestation of the land. All around you shapes move decadently 
in the shadows.

Outside a small farmhouse~
You find youself in front of a run-down farmhouse. Most of the structure 
has collapsed in on itself but enough remains to provide a skeleton of a 
building. A creaky door to the south still hangs loosely from rusty 
hinges and leads into the structure. To the east only thick mists hiding 
a large open area can be seen.
