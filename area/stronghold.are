Before a vast ravine~
Before you lies a deep ravine spanned by a wooden bridge ahead. The

carved out of the earth can barely be seen at the top of the hill, and

A Hallway through Gwenidill~
The walls here are made of some form of smooth metal. A strange glow
seems to eminate from the walls themselves, giving light to the halls. The
air is heavy with age, and the absolute silence of these halls is
devastating. An inch of dust covers the floor , and the eyes of a thousand
years seems to bear down on you.

Every sort of bottle, and instruments of exotic make lie all about in
this room. Tables stacked with jars of strange powerds and shavings of
metal stand against the back wall. A large counter runs nearly the entire
walls space. Diagrams and notes are scribbled on peices of parchment and
attached to the walls. The floors are made of a smooth non-descript stone,
and scorch marks can be seen here and there. The smell of sulfer still
hangs about in the air as if it was used only moments ago.

The Inner Sanctum of Virinahn~
An infinate plane stretches out in all directions. The ground as far as
the eye can see is sand as white as snow. The sky is black and formless
with only a single star in the sky above. A constant breeze blows across
the plane, but without sound, leaving the impression of an infinite void.
