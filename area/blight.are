Long ago, the finest warriors in the borderlands practiced thier skills in
this room, shattered remnants of weapons, and a few skeletons are all that
remains.  Through the blood and wreckage of this room, a slogan is painted all
across the northern wall, 'May peace favor your sword.'  A dream for these long
dead warriors.  One that never came to be...

The air here is much more humid than in the borderland kingdom of Shienar
to the south, each breath is a labor, taxing your strength as you move through
the area.  Trees still grow here, corrupted and twisted by the Shadow that lays
heavily across this cursed land.  Decay and disease surround you on all sides

The Training Room~
Long ago, the finest warriors in the borderlands practiced thier skills in
this room, shattered remnants of weapons, and a few skeletons are all that
remains.  Through the blood and wreckage of this room, a slogan is painted all
across the northern wall, 'May peace favor your sword.'  A dream for these long
dead warriors.  One that never came to be...

The Armoury~
Yoou have come across the towers armoury.  If you could repair what is left
in this shattered room, you could equip a small army.  Unfourtunately, the
Trolloc hordes that fell this mighty tower were very thorough in thier
destruction.  All that is left is twisted metal and splintered wood among the
rotting leather.

The sound of a thousand wings fill your ears as your realize in horror that the
cloud is actually a huge flock of raven.  The Eyes of the Dark One descend upon
you to rend your flesh and spirit.

cells hold skeletons hanging from rotting ropes appearantly made from rotting
bedding.  Surely the Shadowspawn that took the tower would have freed thier

Your mind is still foggy, but a memory of a childhood game struggles to the

hunting snipes, as you survey the scene you realize why.  You are suspeneded in
mid-air by some unseen force, all around you pale humanoids observe you
grinning with canine maws.  They are too tall to be humans, and too thin.  You

seem to get thier attention.  More importantly, as you look at some of the
windows in the room, you see great battles taking place, people you know
talking back in the town you come from, people living and dying, being reborn,
and dying again.  And the men in the room don't even notice!  You feel a great

You stand in the northwest corner of this strange yard.  The wall
surrounding the yard looks like glass, but when you test it's strength you find
it to be harder than steel.  People milling around outside sometimes notice
you, sometimes not.  The other beings in the yard look as confused as you feel.

and shiver as you pass.  Your stomach curls at the stench of evil in everything

You have reached the beginning of Tarwin's Gap.  The largest pass in the
Mountains of Dhoom.  Many great battles have taken place in this gap.
Traditionally the Malkerians defended this gap.  Once that that kingdom fell
the duty fell to the borderland kingdom of Shienar.  You see more than a fist
of Trollocs camped in the gap.  Going further to the north would be suicide.
With the Dragonwall to the east, and the Mountains of Dhoom to the north, you
must turn back.

feed has long since rotted away.  The only exit from this room is to the south,

door, reinforced with iron bars, smashed now into kindling.  To the east and

massive iron portcullis, still intact, and rusted completely shut, it's opening
mechanism either destroyed by the defenders of the tower, or possibly it's

A Guard Room~
You have entered a guard room, this was once used to house the gate guards
during the night, keeping part of the guards at the gate, while others slept
here for quick reinforcements.  No one must have been in this room when the
tower fell, and it is one of the least destroyed rooms in the building.  A few
beds and chests line the walls undisturbed.

The Moutains and the Sea~
A grotesque and disturbing site meets you eyes here.  The Blight continues
on to the south and east with all of it's death and decay strong in your mind.
To the north lay the Mountains of Dhoom, that few men have travelled north of,
and even less have returned.  But, what lies to the west is perhaps the most
disturbing of all.  You are standing on the shore of the Dead Sea.  It's black
and lifeless waters are perfectly still like a huge mirror of pollished
obsidian.  It's calm and lack of life chill you to the bone, surely one step
into those evil waters would mean your death.

A Warded Glade~
You didn't even see this area from the south!  It is not a lucious garden,
but then again, there are actually some green plants here, as well as a spring
flowing with appearantly untainted water.  You can now see the ancient looking
wards suroounding the glade.  Perhaps they were laid buy Lews Therin himself
or one of the Hundred Companions.  Whoever did it, you are just happy to be
here, safe from the horrors of the Blight.
