The Entrance to the Imperial Palace.~
You are standing before a large archway. At either side you there are
Imperial guards staring blankly in front of themselves. Tall spires of
grey stone rise up before you seemingly with no end. Each stone seems 
deliberatly placed as to not disrupt the order of the palace. The smell
of insense wafts through the gates from the inner courtyard and assault 
your senses. Through the gates to the north you see a beautiful courtyard.

the top of the highest spire where stained glass causes filtered light to cascade
down the grey stone walls. To the south you can see the courtyard.
